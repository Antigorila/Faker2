You bring violence and war to thwart the dark realm, but conflict was born in Hell. It is inevitable... a fire that fuels creation and gives purpose where there is none. ... Stand and fight, Slayer. Honor your true God. Fight and show me your purpose.
You were never one of us. You were nothing but a usurper. A false idol. My eyes have been opened. Let me help you to see, Slayer.

Burn the heretic. Kill the mutant. Purge the unclean. It is better to die for the Emperor than to live for yourself.
A Heretic may see the truth and seek redemption. He may be forgiven his past and will be absolved in death. A Traitor can never be forgiven. A Traitor will never find peace in this world or the next.
I am Deathwing, the Destroyer, the end of all things! Inevitable. Indomitable. I am the Cataclysm!
Betrayer. That was what they called him. That was how they would remember him. If they were lucky enough to survive and remember anything, it would be because he had saved them, and they would never know.
You know what is better than drinking a beer? Brewing your own beer. And then drinking it. And then... Drinking another beer. And then, punching somebody in the snout! That's what!
